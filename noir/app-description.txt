Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.

This makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.

And the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it it – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop.

Noir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!

Built from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows.

And just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.

Noir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.

Privacy Policy:
